Workshop, AKA the garage.  This is destined to be one of the most used rooms in the house - bike workshop and storage, guitar workshop, and general storage. It could do with painting.

## Power and lighting circuits
The building has its own fuse box, so it'll be a good first pass at rewiring. I'm planning to use industrial looking galvanised steel conduits and switches and boxes dropped from the ring in the ceiling.

The main power ring: a simple socket radial using junction boxes.
