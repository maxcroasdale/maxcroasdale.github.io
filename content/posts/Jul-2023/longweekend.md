Sat 15t July - Sunday 16th

Rub down the walls. Paint the southwest wall. Take up the floor covering. Clean the floor. Exhausted!


Took all the crappy cardboard to the recycling. For free - Oxfordshire no longer charge! That got me out of the house!

Collect Esther from PR station. :-)

Monday 17th
Placed matting in the principle bedroom. Cleaned the room, moved the bed, put paper down and matting on top. Moved the bed etc... looks great.


Removed the old skanky carpet from the loft. Hot, dirty! Hoovered! Put all the carpet in the motor.

Tuesday 18th

Took carpet to recycling.

Ed came over to fit toilet and basin. We talked next phase. As he's doing all ht epiping for new plumbing we may as well rework the bathroom too. He calls Nick to talk it over. They'll bump us up the list and aim for early September. 3 weeks! Ouch! this will be expensive.

Will have to expose as much of the loft piping as I can. Will have to remove bathroom tiling.
