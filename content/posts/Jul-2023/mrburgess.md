From that first paperback edition of A Clockwork Orange back in 1982(?) to buying as he published in the 80s and collecting first editions back in the 2010's, Anthony Burgess has been a major figure. Here, finally, he's out of boxes and has an entire row (and more) of my bookshelves. Welcome home, Mr Burgess!
