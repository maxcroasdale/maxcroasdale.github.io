Ed the plumber takes the toilet out. It's now in the garden. This opens the space for me to access and lay the final part of the floor. 
Over the course of Saturday, Sunday and Monday morning I problem solve my way through every plank and get the floor finished.

Reposition the underfloor cables so that they are out of the way of toilet and basin - although we'll probably have a wall mounted basin if we can.

Remove the skirting.

and the doors. The doors took the best part of 2 hours to extricate. The screws were so over painted and damaged.

Remove part of the door frame. Taking the whole thing out had the danger of breaking the glass panel. Leave that for now.

This was tricky. Cut the piece such that it hides under the door frame.

This side was initially a very nice match, but too tight. I didn't notice this at first and carried on with the next line. 
Part of it was touching the wall so it wouldn't sit snug with the first plank. When I was laying in the bath it struck me why.
Next morning I took them apart and after a few goes got the side wall with enough space so that the plank would sit flush with its 
partner.

The next challenge was the middle plank fit at either end but not in its middle. After trying three different planks I arranged a cut where the stud wall 
will be and got all the planks to line up snug. Again it took a while to get this done. The line you see will be hidden eventually.

The last planks were relatively straightforward to size and fit, although I was too snug and had to trim three times with the jig saw. A little
bit of careful wall chopping too.

The heavy duck is keeping things in order. I'll glue next week.

Straight through is looking good.

So that was April.
