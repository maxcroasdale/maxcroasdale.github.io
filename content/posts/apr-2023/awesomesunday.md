After an exhausting day yesterday... more of the same. But we have greater confidence and make rapid progress.

Many of the planks are bowed so we set those aside. Consequently we are being very careful with those we accept. We have to be careful 
that a pattern doesn't emerge as we lay the planks. It does!

We finish the music room just after 6pm. Enough. We can do the middle room next time.

The straight through looks fabulous. Very pleased.

Esther's wall hugging technique has produced an excellent result so perhaps we don't need skirting afterall.

Moral of the w/e with laying a floor: be forthright and wham those planks!
