Good Friday. Roots! Quite a challenge to work around these. I'll have to build an enclosure. 
For the moment I'll work around and be careful not to damage them.

And placing the slabs to get them level. There's so much digging out that I don't have enough places in the garden 
to dump it. I'm thinking about a step at the end to get to the bench.
