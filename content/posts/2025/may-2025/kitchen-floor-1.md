Last Friday we went to Lassco - architectural salvage. We found reclaimed pine planks. Delivered today.
I had asked that they bring a trolley to help unload. No trolley.

Sliding the planks (one package) off the truck gave me an idea of the weight - very heavy!
My leather gloves hadn't the grip and I had to lay the planks down twice as we made our way from 
road to garage. I had to steel myself to avoid injury.

I unpacked and hoovered. Despite them saying that they had been sanded, we'll have to sand.
A few of the planks have fire damage. But there should be enough to do the kitchen.
