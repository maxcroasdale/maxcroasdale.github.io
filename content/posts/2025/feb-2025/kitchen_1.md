Here's the kitchen. This will all come out...

The floor will come up as we have to reroute the plumbing. We'll level it, insulate it and a new reclaimed floor will go down. 
The walls will get the treatment as we are rewiring much in prep for the rearrangement of appliances. The boiler 
will be removed and serviced, then put back onto the new floor. This will all happen in the late spring and summer.
