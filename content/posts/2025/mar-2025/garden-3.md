Another hour last night trying to get the first course of bricks level before a retreat to think. 

This morning I placed a wooden support to enclose the gravel and bricks and this will be good enough as a foundation.

I mixed up nearly all the new mortar I bought and embedded first course and then added the second.
I'l let this settle for a week and then add the older bricks. A difficult job to get the wall level on a slope.
Hopefully when the top layer is on and the earth back in place it'll look ok, with just enough ramshackle 
charm to fit with the rest of the place.

I'll then have to raise the level of the path into the garden.
