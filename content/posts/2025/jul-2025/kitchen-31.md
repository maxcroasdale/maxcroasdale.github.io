Out of the consumer unit some cables were running up the wall with pipes and then enclosed in a large box.
Not optimal. Chasing out part of the wall and timber and tucking the cables behind the pipes has created 
space.There's a connection box that needs some attention from an electrician.

Plan will be to cover this corner is a more suitable wood facade.

Chase the wall and insulate the pipes from the cables.
