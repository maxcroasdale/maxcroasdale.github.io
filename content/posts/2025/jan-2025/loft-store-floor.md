I'll level up the left hand side of the loft floor using recycled pieces of wood. I just need to raise the height of the
joists. I'm using recycled metal brackets to fasten the joists as I don't have the correct length of screw. Also
I'm adding to height of the joists with some recycled slats from that stop-gap bed I bought 2 years ago.

I'll strengthen this part of the floor and try and persuade the plumber to move the tank to the left.

I've worked around the bathroom fan outlet with a removable panel.
