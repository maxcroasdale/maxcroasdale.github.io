More rain... another flooded cellar. This gives me an opportunity to use the new pump.

Since this is a regular occurrence we'll make a permanent solution by plumbing the output of the pump. We will also investigate creating a sump so that the cellar does not flood immediately. Last resort will be to tank the cellar. This will be very expensive.
