After the little surprise we had over Xmas - 3feet of plunge pool - the dry season will give me the opportunity to investigate the cellar.

I've removed what passed for a waterproof membrane and found a damp floor and dry walls. We can tank it or install a waterproof membrane with the sump pump. TBD.
