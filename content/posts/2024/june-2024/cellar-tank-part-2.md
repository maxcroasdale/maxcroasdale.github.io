Strip the rest of the walls of that rubber stuff.

The water tank will be a challenge. It's resting on this makeshift table. 
I need to access the floor so will have to remove the table, but I therefore have to prop the tank up.
If I can do this without removing the tank... Can I insert supports attached to the wall to hold it up?
