Heavy rain during the week...

![](/images/1094.jpeg)

The sump and pump does its thing. :-)

All I need now is to add a non-return valve to the pump. At the moment, 
if I leave it on auto the pump will pump out till empty, switch itself off. 
Any water in the pipes will then fall to ground and the pump will start up again in a perpetual cycle.
