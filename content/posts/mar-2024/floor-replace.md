Easter is early this year, but we are laying flooring again over the long w/e. This time in the staircase room.
To replace the chipboard we have 5m<sub>2</sub> of reclaimed pineboards. They need washing and sanding.

## Stage one

Wire brush and washing.

## Stage three

Remove the old chipboard floor.

And clean the rubble and dust. How much crap was between the joists!

And with a little trial and error, lay the replacement pine boards.
