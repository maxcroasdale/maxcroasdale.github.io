Time to tackle the grotty part of the loft. There's not much space but it will be useful storage. 
It's difficult, dusty work in a confined space. I've laid a floor with bits of recycled chip and hardboard.
The tricky part was to level the floor by adding to the joists at the far end by the chimney stack. 
This was slow and painstaking three-day-job made body-aching by the lack of space.

I paint the chimney stack only to find that the mortar is rather damp. Clean it out and re-point.
I'll paint it after the summer when it has dried out. Hopefully.

If this house is an example of

`life-as-antagonism`

_then_ 

`what does not kill me, makes me stronger...`
