After nearly two years in boxes I've installed the big NVA amps. The Music Room is filling up with black boxes!

After a few hours to warm up, they are sounding sweet and musical. They have the ability to create a big sound stage with depth - a real 3D image that's like walking into a concert hall.
They are uncanny in their ability to make sense of a lot of musical information. This present configuration has them about 2.5 metres apart. The whole room sounds great.
