A few weeks since I gave an update. Painted and attempted plastering - ok, but will need some attention before we can paint that wall in the Music room.

Back twisting, neck altering, but we managed it. Lots of detailed cutting in. The new ladder works perfectly.

Ed (Plumber) and Nick (Builder) have been in for a week to sort the downstairs loo. Extended the space with a stud wall and moved the doors, and replastered the wall. Ed has created the plumbing for the w-c and floating sink.

Have cleared out the workshop loft of my old Ikea bookshelves - I'll never use those. I installed a static bike up there - my old single speed. That space is so hot that it'll be a sweat-fest if I ever use it.

Esther has been busy clearing the garden which had sprung into life after the winter calm.
