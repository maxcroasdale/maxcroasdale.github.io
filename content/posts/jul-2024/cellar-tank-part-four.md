Angle grinder

The idea here is to cut out a square as a guide when using the electric hammer. First mark out the square and then wet the floor to minimise dust. 

The tools: Electric hammer and angle grinder.

The plan.

As for minimising dust, I very quickly realise that this will not happen. I'm in a dust white-out within seconds and have to take extreme care. The goggles, ear protectors and breathing apparatus are excellent.

I cut the square to a depth of half the grinder wheel which is about 3inches. That'll have to do.

The dust.

I spend the rest of Tuesday 30th July cleaning. It was wise of me to close all the doors including the cellar hatch.

I have the air purifier running for a few hours and the windows open to take the dust out of the air.

31st July.

Electric hammer

This thing is quite heavy. Getting the bit into it is a challenge.

The noise is colossal at 105db. It jumps around, so I need all my strength to keep it steady and try to hit the line and dig out chunks.
It's quite a skilled job to get this right. A couple of times I go too deep and the bit gets stuck and it takes a lot of manipulation to free it. 
Thankfully there's not much dust.

Take a break. This is hard physical labour and I'm not sure if it's making me stronger or killing me.

Then I hit steel. Whoever prep'd this cellar did a good job with a steel frame and depth of concrete. My pilot was 9inches deep and I think it goes way deeper than that. 
I decide to stop at the steel. I'm down about 4inches. This will be deep
enough as a sump. I just need to make sure that the sump is wide enough to take the pump.

Get the mop out and clean the floor.
