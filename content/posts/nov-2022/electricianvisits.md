Jake, an electrician, visits to prepare a quote to rewire the house and connect the cooker. 

He's happy to connect the cooker but alas it has an internal fault that means we'll have to take it back.

We then walkthrough the entire house and tell him what we want. Expect a quote later next week.

He'll also up the consumer unit in the workshop as that needs a 32 amp fuse for the power ring.
