Despite rather damp conditions I painted the workshop floor this w/e.

Make sure the surface is clean and then roll it on. I was hoping that it would be dry enough after 24 hours to paint again, but it was still tacky to the touch so I'll leave it a week. Looks pretty good though!



Do the periphery first.
