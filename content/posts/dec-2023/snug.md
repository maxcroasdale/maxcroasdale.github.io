Dec 29th and 30th

Remove the sleeping platform and remodel this room with its high ceiling.

Unscrew the hardboard. These are patching the periphery of the loft floor.

Tackle the supports. These are screwed into each other with very long screws into the wall. 
Tough job and I lose a lot of plaster.

I've spent a day and a half so far.

After a great deal of manipulation that tests my strength I free the horizontal upright. 
Tidy and replace the bed. The room is now ready for remodelling. The wall, formerly the outside wall, 
has very interesting beams that are rather worn and scarred but have lots of character. We can make much of this.
