Jake visited today and checked the existing wiring. He's happy that it's in good condition and that we don't have to replace it. This should cut the cost of work needed considerably.

We'll still replace sockets and move lights, have a dedicated line for the audio system, install the thermaskirt in the workshop and front room, and install underfloor heating in the music room and middle room. Work to start in March. There goes my bonus... and more.
