Carpets to carpets

Underlay to dust

To help Jake lay new cables we're taking up the old carpet in the bedroom and stairs. Cut the carpet into sections and roll it up. The underlay literally disintegrates or is already dust as we do this. Messy, dusty, sweaty. Nasty!

Then comes the part we we get rid of the carpet gripper: noisy, tenacious nails and back breaking. Not fun, but we achieved what we needed to. About eight bags of dead carpet went to the Kentish Town Waste that cannot be recycled bin.

Hopefully the consequence will be less dust drifting through the floorboards. we'll see.

Be careful with that bed...it cost me over two grand...
