After a night of very heavy rain (on top of a year of heavy rain) I investigate the cellar.

The level of the water came up to the water tank and we spent an hour Friday night baling (approx 300 lt).

Saturday morning we called a couple of hire shops for a pump. As we're not the only house affected, there's been high demand.

Submersible pump in action.

The water is draining into the drain in the street. Only a minor hazard for traffic.

When we arrived the following Saturday - new pump and hose in hand - we find that all the water remnants have gone. Water table has subsided!
