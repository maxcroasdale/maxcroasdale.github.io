This will be very hard work for very little gain. 


I've drilled a 9inch pilot hole in the floor and still in dry concrete. 
So where is the water ingress? Between floor and wall is my guess.

My thinking is to:

- drain and remove the cylinder
- build a brick structure to hold the cylinder
- replace cylinder in a position that has access to the walls
- plumb in the pump

This will in effect turn the entire cellar into a sump. I'm talking to Plumber and builder.
