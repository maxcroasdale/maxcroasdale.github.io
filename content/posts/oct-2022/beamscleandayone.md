Tuesday 18th October: Day one for the Beam cleaners. After our not too successful attempt at cleaning the beams with Klingstrip, we've hired professionals who use a low impact compression method to gently strip away years of accumulated dirt and or staining. The test strips were successful and we gave them the green light.

Arrival and setup.
