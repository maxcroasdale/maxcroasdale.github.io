After the assualt on the beams, _the big clean_...

Beam cleaning is messy. And contractors will never get near an acceptable level of clean for us, therefore we spent the weekend cleaning. E. meticulously over every inch of the kitchen, me the bedroom, the bathroom and then both the front room. We're talking a forensic level of grit removal. Can you believe that the dust got inside the fridge? _Inside._ Believe!

The bathroom ceiling is about 16 feet high and the dust had settled on the ceiling and walls. I got to about 11 feet, but will have to buy a longer ladder to tackle the remainder. This was tough and humid and required a lot of up and down to clean the mop. Aching after that. When I woke sunday morning I could hardly move. I must start the Five Tibetans again...

We now have an acceptable level of clean.

Removing this light bulb took about ten minutes of gentle coaxing such was the level of grit ingress.

In the evening I brought the audio equipment in from the workshop. Sunday I brought all the other things from workshop in prep for next w/e when I 'll paint the workshop floor with primer.

More cleaning next week.
