After a two week hiatus - last Saturday we had the accident - the Mercedes is gone and replaced with an Audi - I was able to get back to Little Sparta and get some work done.

I'm planning to use the galvanised steel conduit to drop a spur for a power socket of similar galvanised steel finish.

The old socket is in the right place so let's remove it after cutting the power. I'll remove the spur from the preceding socket and keep that live as it's useful for now.

The previous owner installed this socket back in '91.

New steel box in place of the old plastic one.

Fix the junction box and connect the twin and earth cable.

Thread the cable through the galvanised steel conduit.

Attach the cable to the new galvanised steel fascia.

Screw down the fascia and make sure the screws are a '18:00hrs'
