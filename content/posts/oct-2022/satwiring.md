Today was tidy up and a bit of prep for the beam cleaners who arrive on October 18th. Wired the junction boxes with the correct length of cable. Tidied the workshop to maximise the amount of space we have for the timber cleaning guys.

Esther removed some grout from a tile in the front room to see if she could remove the tile. No avail. We'll have to have a rethink about how to do this. The plan is still to install underfloor heating and the question is how to do this without increasing the height of the floor by too much.

We also removed curtain poles etc. as they were attached to beams.

I mixed a little mortar to fill in some holes.
