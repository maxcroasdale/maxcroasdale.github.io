After a near four week hiatus due to hesitancy using the car, we're back. An independent mechanic has opined that there's nothing operationally wrong with the clutch, so I'll modify my gear changing technique and hope there's no recurrence of the burning smell.

Relentlessly busy at work - finished Blueprint 5 at 6:30 Friday December 23!

Christmas came and went.

Back to Little Sparta. All fine generally. Except there's a small amount of viscous liquid pooling on the workshop floor. I think at first that it's water ingress mixed with paint, but closer inspection suggests fuel oil. Have we struck oil? Seeping through the crack between floor and wall? Odd, and we're monitoring to see if it happens again.

So. Carry on with the wiring by drilling holes in the beams for cable to pass through.

Then install the electrical boxes at roughly the same height.

The walls are so non-straight that I'll probably not be able to fit them flush but they are secure enough.

It's bastard freezing the workshop. But a good day's work. Go [here](/posts/2022/dec-2022/workshopwiring-2/) for day two.
