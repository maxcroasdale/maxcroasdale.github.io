Today's the day we really get to grips with the flooring. Great, sunny weather, so the Mitre Saw and jig saw are outside.

We lay the planks carefully and bed them in. Flat and no squeaks.

After a bath and some food, I'm looking at the doorway between middle and music room. I have an idea about how we can hide the floor under the door support.
I get my saw and take an inch off the bottom. It comes off easy as it's not connected to the floor. The plank then fits neatly under and looks nice.
