September is the month we tackle plumbing infrastructure so we may as well re-do the bathroom. It's all coming out, including the airing cupboard wall. We plan to fit a bath, a standalone shower, w/c, bidet, and basin.

Remove the bath panel. Why do previous trades leave so much crap after themselves?
