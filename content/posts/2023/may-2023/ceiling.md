As we're painting between the beams it's easier to use a brush, but involves care not to paint the beams. At Sunday end I paint the far wall. It'll be hidden behind the wall of book and LPs but I want to do it. I use the roller and that's fast.

Monday. More of the same. Up in the apex is slow and contorted but we get half the ceiling done. I also paint the garden side wall panels. I brush first and then roller.
