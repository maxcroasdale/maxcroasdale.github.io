Another hiatus due to us both succumbing to a nasty virus, we're back but not quite raring to go! Feelng very tired. It's a long w/e, so first day we take it easy. I tidy the garage loft - I'm planning to isntall the a static bike here to sweat myself to fitness. I'm exhausted by that effort and sleep for an hour. I install some hooks to hang tyres.

Sunday we prep for painting. We'll start with the ceiling of the music room. We hope we do this with just our adjustable ladder, though it looks like we may have to hire a tower. However, after a few tries and a bit of contortion we figure out how to reach all the ceiling. It involves quite a lot of stretching, but feels safe enough.

Prep
