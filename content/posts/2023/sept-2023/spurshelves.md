We're using narrow shelves from Spur to house CDs, DVDs, and paperback books. These shelves are British classics and used in public buildings and libraries etc. 
These dimensions are discrete enough to fit behind my desk and not look too busy.

Now that we've got these in place we're thinking of extending the shelves all the way across the top of the door frame...
