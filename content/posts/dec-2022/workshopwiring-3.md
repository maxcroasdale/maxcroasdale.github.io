Week three of the wiring. First let's tidy those cables.

The newspaper is to soak up a little water ingress. We're guessing that water is seeping up through the crack between wall and floor. Now that the concrete floor has been painted and it water tight, this is the only way for ground water to rise. I'll have to monitor and solve for this.

Now all that remains is that I connected the new rings to the fusebox. Easy...
